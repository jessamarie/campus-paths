1. There is not much I could have done actually! I am starting to do much
much better at programming then when I started back in homework 4. The 
only thing I could have done better was finish HW4 earlier. 

2. Nothing. Everyone is always very helpful when I ask for help.

3. I know a lot more about Collections, I understand the BFS algorithm,
and I am improving on programming concepts that were not previously my
strong-suit.
