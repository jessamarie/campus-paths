1. function subtypes of A.m: (Z->Y->X)
		- Y m(Object y, Object s);

        X m(X y, String s); //overrides
        Y m(Object y, Object s); //overloads
        Object m(X y, String s) throws RuntimeException; //overrides
        Z m(Y y, String s);  //overloads
      
      
2.1 No, IsoscelesTriangles are expected to have two equal sides, but Triangle violates
this expectation.

2.2 Human is a true subtype because it has a stronger specification
that does not surprise the client. However, Squid is not a true subtype because
a Vertebre is expected to be greater than 0, and Squid violates this expectation.

2.3 Yes, MountainBike is a true subtype because there is nothing in the
specifications to surprise the client.

2. No, because the specification of an overriding method in ConcurrentAccount 
requires an Exception and it should not if it is to be a True subtype.
