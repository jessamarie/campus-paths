1. In order to reduce the time I spent solving this homework,
it would have been best if I had studied ahead of time (which,
unfortunately was difficult for me this week).

2. If possible, could you give us further reading that could help us 
understand the concepts better? (i.e from the textbooks).

3. This homework was a lot less scary than I thought it would
be. At first, I was afraid that I would not be able to grasp 
any of the concepts related to the homework, but I am slowly 
beginning to understand them. I wish I grasped how to use
Dafny before starting the homework, it definitely would have
helped a lot!
