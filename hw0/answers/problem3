1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test? What did you have to do to fix it? 

The program failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because it was throwing the exception for 0 when it 
is not supposed to throw for zero or for a positive number. To solve the problem, you have to change the first if statement 
from n <= 0 to n < 0. This guarantees that 0 cannot come up as a test value for that case.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it? 

The program failed the testBaseCase because it came up as 0 is negative when in fact 0 is not negative.
This was also solved when the first if statement was changed from n=>0 to n>0 for the same reason.

3. Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it? 

getFibTerm() was expected to be 2 but was 1. To solve this problem, you must change two parts of the code. First,
change the second if statement from  n <= 2 to n < 2. Then, you must change the recursive operation from subtraction to addition. 
This solves the failure.
