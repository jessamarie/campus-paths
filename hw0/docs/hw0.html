<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to help you set up your development
environment, get acquainted with Java, and introduce your with tools you will
use for the rest of the course. 
</p>

<p>
If you would like to get more practice with Java,
then we recommend walking through Oracle's Java tutorials described under <a
href="#Problem4">Problem 4</a>. Try to complete Homework 0
first so you can use the tools we describe here when doing the examples in
Oracle's tutorial.
</p>

<p>
You are free to get help from anyone, on any portion of this problem
set; that is,
the <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/syllabus.html">academic 
integrity policy</a> does not apply to this homework. 
</p>
<p>
If you are having trouble with this assignment, get
in touch with us immediately so we can try to get you back on
track. 

<!-- (Not true in 11wi.)
<p>
The first section will consist of the staff in the lab making
sure people get a solid start on this assignment.
</p>
-->

<!-- *********************GETTING STARTED*********************** -->
<h2 id="getting_started">Getting Started</h2>

<!-- TODO: Double check this paragraph. Is there more? -->
You must have Eclipse and Subclipse properly installed
and must have checked out project csci2600 with package hw0 through SVN.


<p>Throughout the course you will receive starter code and submit your assignments 
through Subversion (SVN). SVN is a version control system that allows software engineers
to backup, manage, and collaborate on large software projects (you will learn more
about SVN throughout the course).</p>

<p>Follow the instructions in the 
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/handouts/VersionControl.html">Verision Control handout</a>, which
outlines the basics of SVN.</p>


<!-- ************************PROBLEM 1****************************** -->
<h2 id="Problem1">Problem 1: Your first Java class&mdash;RandomHello</h2>

<p>Create your Java class with a
<tt>main</tt> method that will randomly choose, and then print to the
console, one of five possible greetings that you define.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/handouts/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.html#new">Create the file</a>
<tt>RandomHello.java</tt>, which will define a Java class
named <tt>RandomHello</tt> that will reside in the
Java package <tt>hw0</tt>; that is, assuming your project csci2600, its file name would be
<tt><em>YourWorkspaceDirectory</em>/csci2600/src/hw0/RandomHello.java</tt>.
</p>

<p>Java requires every runnable class to contain a <tt>main</tt>
method whose signature is <tt>public static void main(String[] args)</tt>
(for example, the <tt>main</tt> methods in
<tt>HelloWorld</tt>).
</p>

<p>A code skeleton for the <tt>RandomHello</tt> class is shown
below. Eclipse will generate some of this skeleton for you when you
create the new <tt>RandomHello</tt> class. </p>
<p><tt>RandomHello.java</tt>:</p>
<pre style="font-size:80%;">
package hw0;

/**
 * RandomHello selects a random greeting to display to the user.
 */
public class RandomHello {

    /**
     * Uses a RandomHello object to print
     * a random greeting to the console.
     */
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        RandomHello randomHello = new RandomHello();
        System.out.println(randomHello.getGreeting());
    }

    /**
     * @return a random greeting from a list of five different greetings.
     */
    public String getGreeting() {
        // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This skeleton is meant only to serve as a starting
point; you are free to organize it
as you see fit.
</p>

<h3 id="wheel-reinvention">No Need to Reinvent the Wheel</h3>

<p>Don't write your own random number generator to decide which
greeting to select. Instead, take advantage of
Java's <a class="api"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">
Random</a> class. (This is a good example of the adage "Know and Use
the Libraries" as described in Chapter 7 of Joshua Bloch's
<i>Effective Java</i>. Learning the libraries will take some time,
but it's worth it!)</p>

<p>Type the following into the body of your <tt>getGreeting()</tt>
method:
</p>
<pre>
Random randomGenerator = new Random();
</pre>
<p>
This line creates a random number generator. (Not a <i>random
number</i>, which comes later, but a Java object that
can <i>generate</i> random numbers. In Eclipse, your code may be
marked as an error by a red underline. This is because the
<tt>Random</tt> class is defined in a package that has not yet been
imported (<tt>java.lang</tt> and <tt>hw0</tt> are the only packages
that are implicitly imported). Java libraries are organized as
packages and you can only access Java classes in packages that are
imported. To import
<tt>java.util.Random</tt>, add the following line under the
line <tt>package hw0;</tt> at the top of your file (after
the <tt>package hw0;</tt> declaration):</p>
<pre>
import java.util.Random;
</pre>
<p>This will import the class <a class="api"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">Random</a>
into your file. To automatically add all necessary imports and remove unused
imports, Eclipse lets you type
<b>CTRL-SHIFT-O</b> to
<i><b>O</b>rganize</i> your imports. Because there is only one class
named
<tt>Random</tt>, Eclipse will figure out that you mean to import
<tt>java.util.Random</tt> and will add the above line of code
automatically. (If the name of the class that needs to be imported is
ambiguous &mdash; for example, there is a <a class="api"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html">java.util.List</a>
as well as a <a class="api"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/List.html">java.awt.List</a>
&mdash; then Eclipse will prompt you to choose the one to import.)
</p>

<h3 id="using-random"> Using java.util.Random</h3>

<p>
Read the documentation for <tt>Random</tt>'s <tt>nextInt(int n)</tt> method by going to the <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">Java API</a> and selecting <tt>Random</tt>
from the list of classes in the left-hand frame. Many classes also allow you to
pull up documentation directly in Eclipse. Just hover over the class or
method name and press SHIFT+F2.
</p>

<p>
Use the <tt>nextInt(int n)</tt> method to choose your greeting.
You don't have to understand all the details of its behavior
specification, only that it returns a random number from 0 to n-1.
</p>

<p>One way to choose a random greeting is using an array. This approach
might look something like:
</p>

<pre>
String[] greetings = new String[5];
greetings[0] = "Hello World";
greetings[1] = "Hola Mundo";
greetings[2] = "Bonjour Monde";
greetings[3] = "Hallo Welt";
greetings[4] = "Ciao Mondo";
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>main</tt> method in the skeleton code above prints
the value returned by <tt>getGreeting</tt>.  So if
you insert code in <tt>getGreeting</tt> to select a greeting
randomly, when the class is run it will
will print that greeting.
</p>

<p>
When you are finished writing your
code and it compiles, <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/handouts/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.html#running">run</a>
it several times to ensure that all five
greetings can be displayed.
</p>
<p>Again, now it would be a good idea to add and commit your new class to 
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/handouts/VersionControl.html#Commit">
SVN
</a>.
</p>


<!-- ************************PROBLEM 2****************************** -->
<h2 id="Problem2">Problem 2: Testing Java Code with JUnit</h2>

<!-- <div style="float:right; margin-left:10px;"><img src="junit_failure.png" alt="Screenshot: Run Junit from Eclipse" /></div>-->

<p>
Part of your job as a software engineer is to verify that the software
you produce works according to its specification. One form of
verification is testing. <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/">JUnit</a> is
a framework for creating <em>unit</em> tests in Java. A unit test is a
test for verifying that a given method in a class conforms to its
specification. In this problem, we will provide you with a quick
overview and simple example of how JUnit works. (Later homeworks will
look more deeply into unit testing.)
</p>

<p>Open both <tt>../hw0/Fibonacci.java</tt>
and <tt>../hw0/test/FibonacciTest.java</tt>.
From the comments, you can see that <tt>FibonacciTest</tt> is a
test of the <tt>Fibonacci</tt> class.
</p>

<p>
Now <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/handouts/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.html#junit">run the JUnit
test</a> <tt>FibonacciTest</tt>.
</p>

<p>A window or panel
with a menacing red bar will appear, indicating that some
of the tests in <tt>FibonacciTest</tt> did not complete successfully
(see screenshot at right). The
top pane displays the list of tests that failed, while the bottom pane
shows the Failure Trace for the highlighted test. The first line in the
Failure Trace should display an error message that explains why the
test failed (it is the responsibility of the author of the test code to
produce this error message).</p>

<p> If you click on the
failure <tt>testThrowsIllegalArgumentException()</tt>, the bottom pane
will switch to the appropriate error message. In this example, the
first line of the failure trace shows that
<tt>Fibonacci.java</tt> improperly threw
an <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt> when tested with zero (0) as its
argument. (You may have to scroll the pane to the right to see
this). If you double-click on the name of a test in the top pane, Eclipse
will jump to the line where the failure occurred in the editor pane.
Figure out the problem in <tt>Fibonacci.java</tt>, fix it, and
rerun the JUnit test. Eclipse will automatically rebuild when you make
changes, but if you are running Junit from the command line, you must
manually rebuild (compile) <tt>Fibonacci.java</tt> before you rerun
JUnit.  In Eclipse, this can be done by following
the <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/handouts/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.html#compiling">compiling
instructions</a> and then clicking the "Run" button.
</p>

<p>Use the information in the Failure Trace box to help you continue debugging
<tt>Fibonacci</tt>. Keep a record of what you did to debug
<tt>Fibonacci</tt> as you will have to answer questions about your
debugging experience in the next problem. After you have fixed all the
problems in <tt>Fibonacci</tt>, you should see a bright green bar
instead of a red one when you run <tt>FibonacciTest</tt>.
</p>

<!-- TODO: Figure out what to do with this!
<p> Now look at
the JUnit tests that we wrote for <tt>HolaWorld</tt> and
<tt>RandomHello</tt> in <a href="#Problem5">Problem 5</a> earlier. They are called
<tt>HolaWorldTest</tt> and <tt>RandomHelloTest</tt>,
respectively. Ensure that your modified code passes these tests
before you turn in your homework.</p>
-->

<!-- ***********************PROBLEM 6******************************** -->
<h2 id="Problem3">Problem 3: Answering Questions About the Code</h2>
<p>
In a newly created text file,
answer some questions about the <tt>Fibonacci</tt> class.
Most programming homeworks
that you will be assigned will require you to submit some sort of
response or write-up in addition to your code. Follow these
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/handouts/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.html#new">instructions</a>
to create a text file, named <tt>hw0/answers/problem3.txt</tt>, with
answers to the following questions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Why did Fibonacci fail the
<b>testThrowsIllegalArgumentException</b> test? What did you have to
do to fix it? </li>

  <li> Why did Fibonacci fail the <b>testBaseCase</b> test? What (if
anything) did you have to do to fix it? </li>

  <li> Why did Fibonacci fail the <b>testInductiveCase</b> test? What (if
anything) did you have to do to fix it? </li>
</ol>

<!-- ***************************PROBLEM 4**************************** -->
<h2 id="Problem4">Problem 4: Getting a Real Taste of Java&mdash;Balls and Boxes</h2>

<p>
Until now, we have only been introducing tools. In this problem, we
will delve into a real programming exercise. If you are not familiar
with Java, we recommend working through the Oracle's <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html">
Learning the Java Language tutorial</a>. (Skip the section on generics for now.)
Fragments of Oracle's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">other
tutorials</a> may also be useful, specifically "Getting Started", "Essential
Java Classes", and "Collections".
</p>

<p>
This problem is intended to give you a better sense of what Java
programming entails. This problem can be somewhat challenging. 
Don't be discouraged, we're here to help. And we
expect that time spent now will pay off significantly during the rest
of the course.
</p>

<p>As you work on this problem, record your answers to the various
questions in <tt>problem4.txt</tt> in the
project's <tt>hw0/answers/</tt> directory.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Warm-Up: Creating a Ball</b>:

<p>Take a look at <tt>../hw0/Ball.java</tt>. A <tt>Ball</tt> is a simple object that has a volume.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is wrong with <tt>Ball.java</tt>? Please fix the problems
with <tt>Ball.java</tt> and document your work in <tt>problem4.txt</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have included a JUnit test called
<tt>../hw0/test/BallTest.java</tt> to help you out.
In Eclipse, one of its warnings should help you
find at least one of the bugs without referring to the JUnit
results.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Using Pre-Defined Data Structures</b>:

<p>Next, we want to create a class called <tt>BallContainer</tt>. As before,
skeleton code is provided (see <tt>BallContainer.java</tt>). A
BallContainer is a container for Balls. BallContainer must support the
following methods and your task is to fill in the code that will
implement all these methods correctly:</p>

<ol>
<li> <tt>add(Ball)</tt></li>

<li> <tt>remove(Ball)</tt></li>

<li> <tt>getVolume()</tt></li>

<li> <tt>size()</tt> </li>

<li> <tt>clear()</tt> </li>

<li> <tt>contains(Ball)</tt></li> </ol>

The specifications for these methods are found in the code 
<tt>BallContainer.java</tt>.

<p>
In BallContainer, we use a <a class="api"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">java.util.Set</a> to keep track of
the balls. This is a great example of using a predefined Java data-structure to
save yourself significant work.
</p>

<p>Before implementing each method,
read the documentation for <tt>Set</tt>. Some of your methods will be as simple as
calling the appropriate predefined methods for <a class="api"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">Set</a>. To
help you out, we have included a JUnit test called <tt>../hw0/test/BallContainerTest.java</tt>.</p>

<p>Before you start coding, please take time to think
about the following question (which you need to answer in the text file):</p>
<blockquote>
There are two obvious approaches for implementing
<tt>getVolume()</tt>:
<ol>
<li> Every time <tt>getVolume()</tt> is called, go through all the
Balls in the <tt>Set</tt> and add up the volumes. (<b>Hint:</b>
one solution might use a <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/foreach.html">for-each
loop</a> to extract <tt>Ball</tt>s from the <tt>Set</tt>.)
</li>

<li> Keep track of the total volume of the Balls in <tt>BallContainer</tt>
whenever Balls are added and removed. This eliminates the need to
perform any computations when <tt>getVolume</tt> is called.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which approach do you think is the better one? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><b>Implementing a Box</b>:

<p>
In this problem, you will do a little more design and thinking and a
little less coding. You will implement the <tt>Box</tt> class. A Box is also a container for
Balls. The key difference between a <tt>Box</tt> and a
<tt>BallContainer</tt> is that a Box has only finite volume. Once a
box is full, we cannot put in more Balls. The size (volume) of a Box
is defined when the constructor is called:</p>
<pre>public Box(double volume);
</pre>

<p>Since a <tt>Box</tt> is in many ways similar to a
<tt>BallContainer</tt>, we internally keep track of many things in the
<tt>Box</tt> with a <tt>BallContainer</tt>, allowing us to reuse
code. Many of the methods in <tt>Box</tt> can simply
"delegate" to the equivalent in <tt>BallContainer</tt>; for example,
removing from a <tt>Box</tt> cannot cause it to exceed its volume limit.
This design of having one class contain an object of another
class and reusing many of the latter class's methods is called
<b>composition</b>.
</p>

<p>
(<b>Optional Note</b>: If you are familiar with Java, you may wonder
why we did not simply make <tt>Box</tt> extend <tt>BallContainer</tt>
via "inheritance"; that is, why did we not make <tt>Box</tt> a
subclass of <tt>BallContainer</tt>. We will discuss this much more
deeply later in the course, but the key idea is that <tt>Box</tt> is
not what we call a true subtype of <tt>BoxContainer</tt> because it is
in fact more limited than <tt>BallContainer</tt> (a <tt>Box</tt> can
only hold a limited amount); hence, a user who uses
a <tt>BallContainer</tt> in his code can not simply substitute
that <tt>BallContainer</tt> with a <tt>Box</tt> and assume the same
behavior in his program. (The code may cause the Box to fill up, but
he did not have this concern when using a <tt>BallContainer</tt>).
For this reason, it is not a good idea to make
<tt>Box</tt> extend <tt>BallContainer</tt>.)
</p>

<p>
In addition to the constructor described above, you will need to implement
the following new methods in <tt>Box</tt>:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <tt>add(Ball)</tt></li>

<li> <tt>getBallsFromSmallest()</tt> </li>
</ol>

<p>The specifications for these methods can be found in the code
<tt>Box</tt>. </p>

<p>A few things to consider before you start writing code:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You shouldn't need to implement your own sorting algorithm. Instead, take
advantage of the Java API (remember: "Know and Use the Libraries").</li>

<li>Also, you shouldn't need to change your implementation of
<tt>BallContainer</tt> or <tt>Ball</tt> for this problem.  In particular,
you should not implement the
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html"><tt>Comparable</tt></a> interface.
If you are tempted to do so, consider using
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html"><tt>Comparator</tt></a> instead. <tt>Comparator</tt> is a companion interface to <tt>Comparable</tt>
and is used throughout the Java libraries: check out the sort methods in
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html"><tt>java.util.Collections</tt></a>
as an example.
</li>

<li>If you do make any changes to 
<tt>BallContainer</tt> or <tt>Ball</tt> for this problem, then
explicitly document what changes you made and why in <tt>problem4.txt</tt>.</li>

<li>Be cautious if you plan on using Java's <tt>TreeSet</tt>;
remember that <tt>TreeSet</tt> does not store duplicates, and if you provide
a <tt>TreeSet</tt> with a <tt>Comparator</tt>, it
will use that <tt>Comparator</tt> to determine duplication. See the 
<a class="api" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html">TreeSet</a>
API documentation for more details.</li>

<li>Before you start working on <tt>getBallsFromSmallest()</tt>,
we recommend strongly that you consider using
<a class="api" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html">Iterator</a>.</li>

<li>The JUnit test <tt>../hw0/test/BoxTest.java</tt> should help
you out. However, we do not guarantee that the tests we provide will catch
all bugs in your program.</li>

<li>Oh yeah, don't forget to
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/handouts/VersionControl.html#Commit">commit</a> your code
more than occasionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, take some time to answer the following questions in your text file:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> There are many ways to implement
  <tt>getBallsFromSmallest()</tt>. Briefly describe at least two different ways.
  Your answers should differ in the implementation of <tt>Box</tt>, not in
  lower-level implementation (for example, using an insertion sort
  instead of a selection sort is a lower-level implementation because it does
  not affect how <tt>Box</tt> is implemented). Hint: think about
  different places in the <tt>Box</tt> class where you could add code to achieve
  the desired functionality.</li>
  <li> Which of the above ways do you think is the best? Why?</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no one <b>correct</b> answer. Our intent is to
help you fight that urge to code up the first thing that
comes to mind.
Remember: <b>More thinking, less coding</b>. </p>
</li>
</ol>


<!-- *****************************PROBLEM 5**************************** -->
<h2 id="Problem5">Problem 5: Turning In Your Homework</h2>

<p>You will turn in the solutions for the problem sets, including this one, by
checking them into your SVN repository. All the relevant files should be
included, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java source files we provide that you change. </li>
  <li>Java source code you write. </li>
  <li>Text files, drawings, or documentation of your code.</li>
</ul>
<p> Each homework will indicate exactly what you need to turn in a
Section entitled &ldquo;<a href="#turnin">What to Turn In</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<!--
<p>If you add a new file, you must explicitly add it to your SVN
repository. This means that you need to tell SVN to "track this file"
as part of the repository. In addition, you need
to <b><a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.html#Commit">commit</a></b>
the file to actually put the contents in the repository. Make sure
that, when you're done, your working copy is committed to the
repository so that we get and grade your most up-to-date version.
</p>

<p>Since files like <tt>RandomHello.java</tt>, <tt>problem3.txt</tt>
and <tt>problem4.txt</tt> are not in your SVN repository, you must add
them. You also want to commit the changes you made to
<tt>Fibonacci.java</tt>, <tt>Ball.java</tt>,
<tt>BallContainer.java</tt>, and <tt>Box.java</tt>. </p>
-->

<p>In Eclipse, usually all you'll need to do is right-click on the hw0 folder in
Package Explorer, then select <b>Team  &raquo;  Commit</b>. You don't need
to worry about files you have added (e.g., <tt>RandomHello.java</tt>, 
<tt>problem3.txt</tt>). Eclipse will automatically ask you if you want to 
include these files in the commit.  
</p>

<p>
After completing the above steps, all your code and materials to turn
in should be in your SVN repository. Proceed to the 
<a href="https://submit.cs.rpi.edu/index.php?course=csci2600">Homework Server</a>
to complete the submition of the assignment!
</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b>

Make sure that you have the correct directory structure. If you break the structure, 
compilation on the Homework Server will fail resulting in a grade of 0. 
At this point, you must have project <tt>csci2600</tt> with subdirectory <tt>src</tt>.
Directory <tt>src</tt> must have subdirectory <tt>hw0</tt> and <tt>hw0</tt> must
have subdirectories <tt>answers</tt>, <tt>docs</tt> and <tt>test</tt>. These
show as <tt>hw0</tt>, <tt>hw0.answers</tt>, <tt>hw0.docs</tt> and <tt>hw0.test</tt>
subfolders of <tt>src</tt> in Project Explorer. The Java classes 
(e.g., <tt>Ball.java</tt>) must be in <tt>hw0</tt>, your text files (<tt>problem3.txt</tt> and
<tt>problem4.txt</tt>) must be in <tt>answers</tt> and the JUnit test classes 
(e.g., <tt>BallTest.java</tt>) must be in <tt>test</tt>.</p>



<h2 id="turnin">What to Turn In</h2>
<p>
We should be able to find the following directories and files 
in your <tt>src</tt> directory:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <tt>hw0/RandomHello.java</tt>
 that prints out one of five random messages when its <tt>main</tt>
method is executed. </li>
  <li> <tt>hw0/Fibonacci.java</tt> that passes the three
tests in <tt>hw0/test/FibonacciTest.java</tt>.  (Note that you should
<b>NOT</b> edit <tt>hw0/test/FibonacciTest.java</tt> to accomplish this task.)
</li>
  <li><tt>hw0/Ball.java</tt>, <tt>hw0/BallContainer.java</tt>
  and <tt>hw0/Box.java</tt> that pass their respective JUnit
  tests. (Again, you should not modify the JUnit tests, though you are
  most welcome to read the source code to understand what they test
  for). </li>
  <li> <tt>hw0/answers/problem3.txt</tt> and <tt>hw0/answers/problem4.txt</tt>
  containing answers to the questions
  in Problems 3 and 4. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="turnin">Grade Breakdown</h2>
<p> This homework is worth 50 points. The Homework Server runs the provided JUnit tests 
(plus a few additional tests). Test and debug your code in Eclipse before 
before committing and submitting on the Homework Server! If your code passes
the tests in Eclipse, then it should pass them on the Homework Server too.

<h2 id="optional-problems">Optional Tutorial Problems</h2>
<p>
If you have not had much experience with Java, we recommend that you do
these extra <a href="optional-problems.html">Optional Problems</a>
(source code for these problems can be found in the <tt>hw0.optional</tt>
package that came with your <tt>hw0</tt> checkout).
If you do not know Java well, and we are going too fast, 
the optional problems will help you become more comfortable with Java.

<h2 id="debugger">Optional Debugger Tutorial</h2>
<p>
In this part, you will learn to Eclipse's built-in debugger. As the name
suggests, a debugger helps you debug your program by allowing you to "watch"
your program as it executes, one line at a time, and inspect the state of
variables along the way.  In the past, you may have
used <tt>System.out.println()</tt> to probe the state of a variable or find out
whether a particular line is reached. In that sense, debuggers are like an
ultra-super-powerful <tt>System.out.println()</tt>.
</p>

<p>One of the most useful features of a debugger is the ability to
set <em>breakpoints</em> in your program. When you run your program through the
debugger, it will pause when it reaches a line with a breakpoint. You can
inspect the current state of variables, then continue running your program
normally or step through one line at a time to watch the variables change.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Adder.java. This simple program is supposed to print the sum of two
  user-provided integers. Try running it a few times (or reading the source
  code) and you'll see that it doesn't behave as expected.</li>
  <li>Double-click in the left-hand margin of the class next to the
  line <code>return x - y;</code> A blue circle should appear, indicating a
  breakpoint. (Double-clicking again removes the breakpoint.)</li>
  <li>Run the program in debug mode by using F11, <code>Run >> Debug</code>, or
  the green bug icon in the toolbar. As before, enter two ints (say, 3 and 4) in
  the console when prompted. When your program hits the breakpoint, Eclipse asks
  if you want to open the Debug perspective. Choose yes.</li>
  <li>The debug perspective looks overwhelming at first, but don't worry! In the
  top-right panel, select the "Variables" tab and you'll see the names and
  values of all variables in the current context. The top-left panel ("Debug")
  shows where the program is currently paused, where the current method was
  called, and so on. (This is called the stack trace). Double-click on a method
  name to see the corresponding line in the panel below, where you can view and
  edit your source code. Finally, the bottom-left panel shows the console
  window.
  <p><em>What are all the names and values listed in the "Variables" panel? What
  does the "Debug" panel list as the current method and line number? (Write down
  the text that was highlighted when the Debug perspective first
  opened.)</em></p></li>
  <li>Immediately above the "Debug" panel are several buttons for running your
  program. Mouse over each one for a description. "Resume" (green arrow) causes
  your program to continue executing normally until it finishes or hits another
  breakpoint. If you want to monitor what happens shortly after the breakpoint,
  use "Step Into" and "Step Over" (yellow arrows). "Step Over" executes the
  current line and pauses on the next line. "Step Into" enters any method called
  on the current line so you can execute that method line-by-line. (To finish
  the current method and jump back to the caller, use "Step Out.") Hit "Step
  Over" once to execute the <code>return</code> statement and
  exit <code>computeSum</code>. Hit "Step Over" again to progress to the next
  line.
  <p><em>What are all the names and values listed in the "Variables" panel after
  EACH of the two step overs?</em></p></li>
  <li>Hit "Resume" to allow the program to finish executing. Return to the
  default Java perspective by clicking "Java" in the top-right corner or by
  going to <code>Windows >> Open Perspective >> Other...</code> and selecting
  Java (default).</li>

This section will list clarifications and answers to common questions
about homeworks. We'll try to keep it as up-to-date as possible, so
this should be the first place to look (after carefully rereading the
homework handout and the specifications) when you have a problem.
