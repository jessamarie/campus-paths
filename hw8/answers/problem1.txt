List of all code smells identified:

BooleanExp class:
	- entire class should be made abstract and divided
	into parts 
	- toString() switch statement which is also
	  duplicate code with the switch statement in
	ExpressionParser.print(boolean, BoolExp). (They
	almost do the same thing). This could be solved 
	with the Strategy/State pattern.
 
 ExpressionParser class:
   - It might be better if the context class is in it's own file
   - Too many conditionals
   - parse(string) method is too long and unreadable
   - print(boolean, BoolExp)
      	1. The method is too long
   		2. switch statements are bad
   		3. Duplicate switch as mentioned before
   - unnecessary coupling
   - evaluate() should be moved to BooleanExp
