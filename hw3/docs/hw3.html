<p>As always, we recommend that you read the entire homework before you begin work. 
As always, you must commit to your SVN repository, then submit through the Homework server.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This homework focuses on reading and interpreting
specifications, and reading and writing Java source code. Additionally,
you will be given an introduction to using <tt>checkRep</tt> methods
and testing strategies. You will implement one class that will
complete the implementation of a polynomial with rational coefficients, and
you will answer questions about both the code you are given and the
code you are going to write.</p>

<p>To complete this homework, you will need to know:</p><ol>
  <li>Basic algebra (rational and polynomial arithmetic) and polynomial arithmetic
  <li>How to read and write basic Java code
       <ul>
         <li>code structure and layout (class and method definition, field and variable declaration)</li>
         <li>method calls</li>
         <li>operators for:
           <ul>
             <li>object creation:  <tt>new</tt></li>
             <li>field and method access:  <tt>.</tt></li>

       </ul></li>
  <li>How to read procedural specifications in the PoS convention (requires, modifies, effects, returns and throws)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Problems">Problems</h2>

<p>
You should have files <tt>RatNum.java</tt> and <tt>RatPoly.java</tt> in directory hw3,
and files <tt>RatNumTest.java</tt>, <tt>RatPolyTest.java</tt> and <tt>RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt>
in directory hw3.test. (<tt>RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt> is only needed for the extra credit problem
which asks for polynomial division. It shows errors because the division operation has 
not been added yet to <tt>RatPoly.java</tt>.)
Read through the spcifications in <tt>RatNum.java</tt> and <tt>RatPoly.java</tt>
to help you work through the problems below.
</p>

<h3 id="Problem-1">Problem 1: RatNum (5pts)</h3>

<p>For this first problem you don't have to write any code, but you do have to answer written questions.
Read the specifications and provided implementation in <tt>RatNum.java</tt>, a class representing rational numbers. 
</p>

<p>You may want to look at the code in <tt>RatNumTest.java</tt>
to see example usages of the RatNum class (albeit in the context of a test
driver, rather than application code).</p>

<p>Answer the following questions, writing your answers in the file <tt>hw3/answers/problem1.txt</tt>.  <strong>Two or three sentences should be enough to answer each question.  For full credit your answers should be short and to the point.  Points will be deducted for answers that are excessively long or contain irrelevant information.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
Classify each public method of RatNum as a <i>creator</i>, <i>observer</i>, <i>producer</i> or <i>mutator</i>.
</li>

<li>
What is the point of the one-line comments inside the
<tt>add</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>,
<tt>mul</tt>, and <tt>div</tt> methods?</li>

<li>
<tt>add</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>, <tt>mul</tt>, and <tt>div</tt> all require that "arg != null".
This is because all of the methods access fields of 'arg' without checking
if 'arg' is null first. But the methods also access fields of 'this'
without checking for null; why is "this != null" absent from the requires-clause
for the methods?</li>

<li>
<tt>RatNum.div(RatNum)</tt> checks whether its argument is NaN
(not-a-number).  <tt>RatNum.add(RatNum)</tt> and
<tt>RatNum.mul(RatNum)</tt> do not do that.  Explain.</li>

<li>
Why is <tt>RatNum.valueOf(String)</tt> a static method? What alternative to
static methods would allow one to accomplish the same goal of generating
a RatNum from an input String?</li>

<li>
Imagine that the representation invariant were weakened so that we did
not require that the <tt>numer</tt> and <tt>denom</tt> fields be stored in reduced form.
This means that the method implementations could no longer assume this
invariant held on entry to the method, but they also no longer would be required
to enforce the invariant on exit. The new rep invariant would then
be:
<blockquote><pre>
// Rep Invariant for every RatNum r: ( r.denom >= 0 )
</pre></blockquote>

<p>List the method or constructor implementations that would have to
change. For each changed piece of code,
describe the changes informally, and indicate how much more or less
complex (in terms of code clarity and/or execution efficiency) the
result would be. Note that the new implementations must still adhere
to the given spec; in particular, <tt>RatNum.toString()</tt> needs to
output fractions in reduced form. <!--(Hint: also, <tt>2/4</tt> must still equal
<tt>1/2</tt>.)-->
</p>
</li>

<li><tt>add</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>, <tt>mul</tt>, and <tt>div</tt> all end
with a statement of the form <code>return new RatNum ( numerExpr ,
denomExpr);</code>.  Imagine an implementation of the same function
except the last statement is:
<blockquote><pre>
this.numer = numerExpr;
this.denom = denomExpr;
return this;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>For this question, pretend that the <tt>this.numer</tt> and <tt>this.denom</tt>
fields are not declared as <tt>final</tt> so that these assignments compile properly.
How would the above changes fail to meet the
specifications of the function (Hint: take a look at the <tt>@requires</tt> and
<tt>@modifies</tt> statements, or lack thereof.) and fail to meet the
specifications of the RatNum class?</p>
</li>

<li>Calls to <tt>checkRep</tt> are supposed to catch violations in
the classes' invariants.  In general, it is recommended that one call
<tt>checkRep</tt> at the beginning and end of every method.  In the
case of <tt>RatNum</tt>, why is it sufficient to call
<tt>checkRep</tt> only at the end of the constructors?  (Hint: could a
method ever modify a <tt>RatNum</tt> such that it violates its
representation invariant?  Could a method change a <tt>RatNum</tt> at
all?  How are changes to instances of <tt>RatNum</tt> prevented?)  </li>

</ol>


<h3 id="Problem-2">Problem 2: RatPoly (45pts: Code: 40pts autograded, Answers: 5pts)</h3>

<p>Read over the specifications for the <tt>RatPoly</tt> class, making sure
you understand the overview for RatPoly and the specifications for the given methods.
Read through the provided skeletal implementation of <tt>RatPoly.java</tt>.

<p>Fill in an implementation for all methods.

<!-- except for 
<code>differentiate()</code>, <code>antiDifferentiate(RatNum integrationConstant)</code>
and <code>integrate(double lowerBound, double upperBound)</code>. If implement you
these three methods you will earn 10 points extra credit for the assignment.
-->

<p>You may define new private helper methods as you like.<!--; we have suggested
a few ourselves, complete with specifications, but you are not obligated
to use them. (We believe that doing so will simplify
your implementation.)--> You may not add public methods; the external
interface must remain the same. (If you implement the Extra credit
question you will have to add one specific public method.)

If you define new methods, you must specify them completely.  
You can consider the specifications of existing methods
(where you fill in the body) to be adequate.  You should comment any code
you write, as needed; please do not over-comment.
</p>

<p>We have provided a <tt>checkRep()</tt> method in RatPoly that tests
whether or not a RatPoly instance violates the representation
invariants.  We highly recommend you use <tt>checkRep()</tt> where appropriate in the
code you write.  Think about the issues discussed in the last question
of problem 1 when deciding where <tt>checkRep</tt> should be called.
</p>

<!--<p>Take a look
at the RatPoly.degree() function for a simple way to include
<tt>checkRep()</tt> in your code.  Simply place the entire main body
of your code inside a <tt>try { ... }</tt> block, and append <pre>
finally {
    checkRep();
}</pre>
to your code.</p>
-->

<p>There is a fairly rigorous test suite in <tt>RatPolyTest.java</tt>. You
can run the given test suite with JUnit to evaluate
your progress and the correctness of your code. 
It is probably a good idea to run tests individually 
rather than runnning the entire suite at once.</p>


<p>Answer the following questions, writing your answers in the file <tt>hw3/answers/problem2.txt</tt>.  
<strong>Remember, keep your answers to 2-3 sentences.</strong></p>
<ol>

<li>
We have chosen the array representation of a polynomial: <code>RatNum[] coeffs</code>, 
where <code>coeffs[i]</code> stores the coefficient of the term of exponent <code>i</code>. 
An alternative data representation is the list-of-terms representation: <code>List&lt;Term&gt; terms</code>, where each Term 
object stores the term's RatNum coefficient and integer exponent. 
The beauty of the ADT methodology is that we can switch from one representation to
the other without affecting the clients of our RatPoly! 
Briefly list the advantages and disadvantages of the array representation 
versus the list-of-terms representation.
</li>

<li>
Where did you include calls to <tt>checkRep</tt> (at the
beginning of methods, the end of methods, the beginning of
constructors, the end of constructors, some combination)?  Why?
</li>


<li> Imagine that the representation invariant of <tt>RatPoly</tt> was weakened so that we
did not require the last element of <code>coeffs</code> to be non-0. 
This means that the method implementations could
no longer assume this invariant held on entry to the method, but they
also no longer were required to enforce the invariant on exit.
Which method or constructor implementations will change? Please list them.  
For each changed piece of code,
describe the changes informally, and indicate how much more or less
complex (in terms of code clarity and/or execution efficiency) the
result would be. Note that the new implementations must still adhere
to the given spec.</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="Problem 3">Problem 3: Polynomial division (10pts EXTRA CREDIT: Pseudocode and invariant: 5pts, Java code: 5pts autograded)</h3>

<p>
Write a pseudocode algorithm for division. State the loop invariant for the main loop. 
You do not need to prove partial correctness, just give the right invariant. 
Write your answer in the file <tt>hw3/answers/problem3.txt</tt>.
</p>

The following is the definition of polynomial division:
<blockquote>
        <p>Division of polynomials is defined as follows:</p>
        <p>Given two polynomials u and v, with v != "0", we can divide u by
        v to obtain a quotient polynomial q and a remainder polynomial
        r satisfying the condition u = "q * v + r", where
        the degree of r is strictly less than the degree of v,
        the degree of q is no greater than the degree of u, and
        r and q have no negative exponents.</p>

        <p>For the purposes of this class, the operation "u / v" returns
        q as defined above.</p>

        <p>The following are examples of div's behavior:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>(x^3-2*x+3) / (3*x^2) = 1/3*x (with r = "-2*x+3").</li>
            <li>(x^2+2*x+15) / (2*x^3) = 0 (with r = "x^2+2*x+15").</li>
            <li>(x^3+x-1) / (x+1) = x^2-x+2 (with r = "-3").</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Note that this truncating behavior is similar to the behavior
        of integer division on computers.</p>
</blockquote>
For this question, you do not need to handle division by zero;
however, you will need to do so for the Java programming exercise.

<p>Next, add a public method <tt>public RatPoly div(RatPoly p)</tt> with appropriate
specification to the <tt>RatPoly</tt> class and transfer your pseudocode algorithm 
into <tt>div</tt>. You may assume that the divisor <tt>p</tt> is non-null. If <tt>p</tt>
is zero <tt>div</tt> returns some <tt>q</tt> such that <tt>q.isNaN</tt>.
As with the other operations (e.g., <tt>mul</tt>), if <tt>this.isNaN</tt> 
or <tt>p.isNaN</tt>, <tt>div</tt> returns some <tt>q</tt> such that <tt>q.isNaN</tt>.
</p>

<p>There is an extensive test suite for division in <tt>RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt>. You
can run this test suite to evaluate your progress and the correctness of your code.</p>

<h3 id="Problem-6">Problem 6: Invariant detection (4 points)</h3>

<p> Daikon is a software engineering tool that reports properties
about programs similar to representation invariants and method pre-
and postconditions.  Please read the <a
href="../../tools/daikon.html">introduction to Daikon</a>.  </p>

<p> For this problem, you will generate and analyze the results of
running Daikon on the <tt>RatNum</tt> class using two different test suites:
<tt>RatNumTest</tt>, the original test suite, and
<tt>RatNumSmallTest</tt>, a reduced test suite that does not provide as much coverage.</p>

<p> To ease your work, we have provided you with <tt>ant</tt> targets
to run Daikon with the correct arguments for this particular problem.
Like most of the other targets (e.g. "build"), these targets can be run from
either <a href="../../tools/editing-compiling.html#ant-eclipse">Eclipse</a> or the command line.
</p>

<p>First, run Daikon from your hw3 directory using the original RatNum test suite (<tt>RatNumTest</tt>):</p>
<pre>
ant daikon-RatNumTest
</pre>

<p>This command will place Daikon's results in
<tt>daikon-RatNumTest.inv.txt</tt> in your <tt>hw3</tt> directory.
If you are using Eclipse, you will need to refresh the <tt>hw3</tt> directory
to see the results file in the <b>Package Browser</b>.</p>

<p> Next, run Daikon on the reduced RatNum test suite (<tt>RatNumSmallTest</tt>):</p>
<pre>
ant daikon-RatNumSmallTest
</pre>

<p>This command will place Daikon's results in
<tt>daikon-RatNumSmallTest.inv.txt</tt> in the <tt>hw3</tt> directory.
If you are using Eclipse, you will need to refresh the <tt>hw3</tt> directory
to see the results file in the <b>Package Browser</b>.</p>

<p>Please answer the following questions in the file
<tt>hw3/answers/problem6.txt</tt>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Examine the representation invariants Daikon generates for
  <tt>RatNum</tt> using the original test suite.  These can be found at
  the top of the <tt>daikon-RatNumTest.inv.txt</tt> file under the
  heading <tt>hw3.RatNum:::OBJECT</tt>.  Does Daikon generate the same
  invariants that are recorded in the representation invariant of
  <tt>RatNum</tt>?  How do they differ?</li>

  <li>Compare the invariants generated by Daikon at the
  entrance of the <tt>RatNum.sub</tt> method (found under the heading <tt>hw3.RatNum.sub(hw3.RatNum):::ENTER</tt>), using the two different test suites.
  How are the invariants generated by the two test suites different?
  What do the differences tell you about the test cases that are
  missing from the reduced test suite for <tt>RatNum.sub</tt>?
  That is, what case is the reduced test suite not testing?
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
You should not commit any of the Daikon-generated files to your Subversion
repository.
</p>

<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<p>Please answer the following questions in a file named <tt>collaboration.txt</tt> in your
<tt>answers/</tt> directory.</p>
<p>
The standard <a
href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/syllabus.htm">academic integrity
policy</a> applies to this homework.
</p>
<p>
State whether or not you collaborated with other students.
If you did collaborate with other students, state their names and a brief
description of how you collaborated.
</p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>

<p>Please answer the following questions in a file named <tt>reflection.txt</tt> in your
<tt>answers/</tt> directory.  Answer briefly, but in enough detail to
help you improve your own practice via introspection and to enable the
course staff to improve PoS in the future.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you
  spent solving this homework?</li>
  <li>What could the PoS staff have done better to improve your learning experience
  in this homework?</li>
  <li>What do you know now that you wish you had known before beginning the
  homework?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="submit">What to submit</h3>

<p>By the end of the homework, you should have the following files
committed to SVN in your hw3 directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>answers/problem1.txt</tt></li>
<li><tt>answers/problem2.txt</tt></li>
<li><tt>answers/problem3.txt</tt>(Extra credit)</li>
<li><tt>RatPoly.java</tt></li>
<li><tt>answers/collaboration.txt</tt></li>
<li><tt>answers/reflection.txt</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>All of the unfinished methods in RatPoly throw
<a
class="api"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html">RuntimeException</a>s.
When you implement a method, you should be sure to
remove the <code>throw new RuntimeException();</code> statement.  For those of you who
use Eclipse, we have also added a <tt>TODO:</tt> comment in each of these
methods.  The "Tasks" window will give you a list of all <tt>TODO:</tt>
comments, which will help you find and complete these methods.
</p>

<p>Think before you code!  The polynomial arithmetic functions are not
difficult, but if you begin implementation without a specific plan, it is
easy to get yourself into a terrible mess. Fortunately, you did write pseudocode
for most of the polynomial arithmetic algorithms in Homework 2. 
</p>

<p>The provided test suites in this homework are the same ones we will
use to grade your implementation; in later homeworks the staff
will not provide such a thorough set of test cases to run on your
implementations, but for this homework you can consider the
provided set of tests to be rigorous enough that <b>you do not need to
write your own tests</b>.</p>
