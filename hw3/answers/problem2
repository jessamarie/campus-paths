1.  Advantages: Access to every element in the array using indexes. This also gives the array implementation
	the advantage of being faster.

	Disadvantages: A  list is easier to add and remove elements from and the size will
	automatically adjust. Array sizes are fixed.  It is harder to insert an elements in
	the middle of an array.
	
2. I included calls to checkRep() at the beginning and all methods, but isNaN(), degree(), 
since they are just returning values. This ensures that the Rep invariant was satisfied 
before the code and after the code of the method. I only included constructors at the 
end because since it's creating coeffs there is no need to check it's values. I did not checkRep() for the methods
