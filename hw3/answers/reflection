1.In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you spent solving this homework?

I could have had a better handle on java programming before I started this homework. It would have saved
me the time of not knowing how to implement some of the methods, let alone debug.


2.What could the PoS staff have done better to improve your learning experience in this homework?
Nothing better this time. Everyone was so helpful!

3.What do you know now that you wish you had known before beginning the homework?

I wish I had understood more about the concepts related to the homework, and also
about the java programming language. I feel like I have learned so much and progressed
so far just by doing this homework!
