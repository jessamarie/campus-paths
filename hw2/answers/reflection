1. In order to reduce the time spent doing this homework I could manage my time
better overall. This may be the reason I am having trouble understanding the 
concepts in the homework and slides. I am currently implementing a new strategy
in order to better distribute time spent studying and doing homework for my
classes.

2. I think that the TA's should be required to look over the homework and understand
the problems in order to be able to help us. I recently went to a TA for help, but this
TA was not able to give me the help that I needed. 

3. I wish that I understood computation induction. I am still having trouble with it now,
but it is becoming easier the more problems I do.
