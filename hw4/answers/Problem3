I decided to first break up my tests into three parts: Vertex Tests,
 Edge Tests, and and Digraph Tests. This makes it easier to start small,
 making sure the Vertex and Edge classes work before moving on to the Digraph.
 For each test case, I worked generally from the top to the bottom of the main 
 classes, unless there was a more important method to test first. In the DigraphTest,
 I often tested many elements at once (with inspiration from IntPriorityQueueTest.java),
 since this ensures that the elements will work well together and it may not have 
 been as effective if done otherwise. For each method I made sure to test for valid and
 invalid inputs specified in the specifications 
 
 I did not add any extra test cases because it seemed that my cases
 were sufficient enough to meet the coverage requirements (and I covered
 most of the branches).
