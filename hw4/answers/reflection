1. I think overall it would have been easier for me to finish this project if I understood
more about the Java programming language. I am definitely wishing at this point that
I took RPI's data structures course because I definitely would be a more experienced
coder than I am right now! Nevertheless, I feel very accomplished for getting this project
finished!

2. Nothing much, everyone is always very helpful when I ask for help.

3. Honestly, everything! When I had first started out this project I felt so
completely hopeless and thought that I would never get it done! Now, I feel like
I have knowledge of how to make classes work together, how to work with collections,
and I feel like I have become a better programmer!
