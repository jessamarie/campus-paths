1. I have decided that my representation will use an adjacency list. The Digraph
object will consist of a List that holds the List of edges in the graph and the 
adjacency list, a Map which uses Vertices as keys and an ArrayList of edges for the value of
each Vertex. The advantage of using an Adjacency list representation is that it is faster to 
iterate over all of the edges. The advantage of an adjacency matrix is that it is faster to
to lookup whether an edge exists, and the an advatage of a Collection is that it is easy to 
return all of the edges of the set. I chose an adjacency list because I thought it was the right structure given the type of graph
we had to create.
